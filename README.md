## üé® Design

- Slideshow Component
We developed a seamless slideshow using React to handle images dynamically, allowing for a smooth, infinite scroll effect. The component is fully responsive and adjusts the images based on screen size.

- Blog System
Astro's content collections are used to manage the blog posts. Each post is written in markdown, and thanks to Astro's dynamic routing, each post is accessible via its own unique URL, following SEO best practices.

- Mobile-First Navigation
The project includes a toggle menu that ensures a smooth transition from desktop navigation to a mobile-friendly burger menu, built with Tailwind‚Äôs utility classes for transitions and animations.
